# Java Game Services

## Description

<hr>
This is a hobby project that I enjoy working on in my spare time.
This project acts as a focal point for me to learn and grow as an engineer, 
by working through the entire lifecycle of complex service-based platform. I've found that many engineers can become overspecialized, 
or become blind to many of the aspects of software implementation which are out of their immediate set of responsibilities.
I believe that by flexing myself on this project, I can gain a more holistic understanding of platform development.

The project may pivot throughout the lifetime of it, and I expect that I will add new goals and
functionality,
perhaps even with connected clients that can meaningfully make use of this platform.

## Goals and Wishlist
