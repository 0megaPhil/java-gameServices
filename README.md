## Description
<hr>
This is a hobby project that I enjoy working on in my spare time.
This project acts as a focal point for me to learn and grow as an engineer, 
by working through the entire lifecycle of complex service-based platform.

The project may pivot throughout the lifetime of it, and I expect that I will add new goals and functionality, 
perhaps even with connected clients that can meaningfully make use of this platform.

## Goals and Wishlist
<hr>
I have many greater and lesser goals for this project, and many will take me quite some time, 
however, here are some of my aspirations. 

- Simple game focused platform
  - Inventory
  - Characters
  - World
- Cloud-first architecture
- Horizontally scalable
- High-performance
- Reactive ready API
- OpenApi Swagger support
- Security focused
